# Data Ethics and Bias Mitigation

## Ethical AI Principles

1. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**
   - Ensure AI systems don't discriminate
   - Regular bias audits and testing

2. **Transparency and Explainability**
   - Make AI decisions understandable
   - Document model logic and data sources

3. **Privacy and Data Protection**
   - Respect user privacy
   - Implement data minimization

4. **Accountability**
   - Clear ownership of AI systems
   - Mechanisms for redress

## Bias Mitigation Strategies

### Pre-processing
- Balanced dataset collection
- Bias detection in training data
- Reweighting or resampling techniques

### In-processing
- Fair learning algorithms
- Adversarial debiasing
- Regularization techniques

### Post-processing
- Threshold optimization
- Calibration
- Output transformation

## Fairness Metrics
- Demographic Parity
- Equal Opportunity
- Equalized Odds
- Individual Fairness
