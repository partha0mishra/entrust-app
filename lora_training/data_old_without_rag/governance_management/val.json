Summary\n\nPerformance in Policy Development is currently adequate but not optimized. The score spread demonstrates lack of standardization, and comments signal repeated issues with documentation, stakeholder engagement, and process integration. Action should focus on formalizing and communicating clear policies, driving expanded training, and embedding governance accountability into both operational and audit processes. Pursuing these strategic improvements should materially close observed gaps, strengthen organizational trust in governed data, and align practice to industry benchmarks."

Key gaps stem from absent formal governance structures, outdated tools, and ambiguous accountability, as evidenced by limited respondent engagement and variable departmental maturity. Addressing these through formalization, standardization, and capability enhancement is essential. Actionable recommendations include establishing the Data Governance Office, investing in modern stewardship tools, clarifying roles, and instituting robust compliance and risk practices. Progress should be monitored using clear success metrics, aiming for substantial improvements within 6 to 12 months."

the organization evidences awareness and partial deployment of core principles (asset recognition, accountability, quality, and operating model). However, scores reflect a **medium level of maturity overall**, characterized by well-established compliance practices but **significant gaps in data stewardship, policy enforcement, and implementation consistency**.\n\n**Immediate priorities** should focus on strengthening stewardship, clarifying roles, automating policy enforcement, and integrating robust monitoring across the data governance lifecycle. This progression will align the organization closer to advanced maturity stages as defined by leading frameworks.\n\n---\n\n**All structured data above presented in standard markdown table format for executive clarity.**"
