Progress should be tracked across the defined success metrics to elevate governance maturity, reduce variability, and cement continuous improvement. Each recommendation should be owned and actioned within clearly defined timelines to close identified gaps."

Control failures stem primarily from weak governance culture, patchy policy enforcement, and irregular reporting. Increasing policy standardization, expanding targeted training, automating reporting, and integrating lifecycle cost analysis will significantly boost alignment, compliance, and audit readiness. Success should be closely tracked using clear and regularized metrics as outlined above."
