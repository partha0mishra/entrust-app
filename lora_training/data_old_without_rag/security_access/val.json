Access is moderate but must be elevated to meet the rigor of NIST and ISO 27001 frameworks. Specific attention to low-scoring areas such as Data Masking, Incident Handling, and Access Management is critical. The organization should invest in modern IAM, automate security response, expand encryption, and establish regular control reviews—all mapped directly to industry best practices.\n\nRegular dashboarding, targeted training, and actionable metrics will support continuous improvement and stakeholder buy-in. Execution of these recommendations will advance the maturity model and significantly reduce both compliance risk and exposure to data security threats.\n\n---"
