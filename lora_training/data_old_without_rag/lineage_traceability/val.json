There is clear evidence of both pockets of maturity and significant areas for improvement. Accelerating role assignment, automating lineage tracking, and integrating lineage with business context should deliver measurable progress within 6-12 months. Consistent governance metric tracking will enable ongoing assessment and further refinement."

Success should be monitored via coverage, effectiveness, and responsiveness metrics."
