The average score (3.88/10) and narrow response rate underscore insufficient engagement, weak culture, and fragmented processes. Root cause analysis pinpoints cultural, procedural, and technological deficiencies—particularly the absence of automated classification, poor lineage visibility, and unclear ownership.\n\nTo elevate maturity to 8 / 10 within a year, the organization must:\n\n1. **Institutionalise governance** through a council that defines vision, KPIs, and accountability.  \n2. **Centralise metadata** with an enterprise catalog that auto‑extracts lineage and tags owners.  \n3. **Automate classification** using ML to detect PII, reducing manual effort and risk.  \n4. **Capture tribal knowledge** formally so legacy expertise is preserved.  \n5. **Educate the workforce** via mandatory training on data stewardship roles.\n\nProgress will be tracked through defined success metrics that focus on maturity score, lineage coverage, automated classification, training penetration, and owner clarity. With disciplined execution of the high‑priority actions above, the organization can expect to meet its 12‑month target of an *8.0/10* Governance Maturity Score."

    "output": "# Data Dictionary – Governance Assessment Report  \n*Prepared for the Data Governance Review Committee – November 2025*\n\n---\n\n## Performance Assessment  \n\n| Metric | Current Value | Target Value | Gap | Status |\n|--------|---------------|--------------|------|--------|\n| **Average Score** | 5.38/10 | 8.0/10 | –2.62 | Below Target |\n| **Score Range** | 1.0 – 10.0 | 7 – 10.0 | Low end below target | Needs Improvement |\n| **Response Rate (respondents)** | 3 | 20 | –17 | Low Response Rate |\n\n*Interpretation*:  \n- The average score of **5.38** indicates that most respondents perceive the data dictionary as only partially functional; only a handful of items are meeting best‑practice expectations.  \n- The **score range** shows wide variability, with some respondents rating the category at 1 (complete lack of functionality) and others at 10 (fully compliant).  \n- Only **3 respondents** out of 104 possible answered, underscoring limited insight into actual usage.\n\n---\n\n## Root Cause Analysis  \n\n| Root Cause | Impact Level | Evidence | Contributing Factors |\n|------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|\n| **Fragmented metadata tooling** | High | “Technology tools for governance are not implemented or outdated” | Legacy systems; no single‑source platform |\n| **Limited awareness & training** | Medium | “Training and awareness efforts are minimal or nonexistent” | No formal adoption program, lack of champions |\n| **Absence of automated capture** | High | “Metadata management solution integrated with ETL/ELT tools for automated capture?” – low score | Manual processes, no integration pipelines |\n| **Governance process gaps** | Medium | “Immediate action required to establish foundational governance controls” | Missing approval workflows, unclear ownership |\n\n---\n\n## Specific Recommendations  \n\n| Priority | Recommendation | Owner | Timeline | Expected Impact | Effort |\n|----------|----------------|-------|-----------|---------------|--------|\n| High | Deploy a single authoritative metadata management tool that is centrally governed and integrated with all ETL/ELT pipelines. | Chief Data Officer (CDO) | 0‑3 months | Immediate uplift to data dictionary completeness & consistency | **High** |\n| High | Formalize a change‑control workflow for critical business metadata, including version control and approval gates. | Data Governance Manager | 0‑2 months | Reduce errors, improve auditability | **Medium** |\n| Medium | Implement an enterprise business glossary with active stewardship by domain owners; integrate this into the data catalog search UI. | Domain Stewards (Finance, Sales) | 1‑4 months | Increase adoption of definitions, reduce ambiguity | **Medium** |\n| Medium | Conduct a comprehensive training program for analysts & report developers on how to use the new metadata platform and business glossary. | Learning & Development Lead | 2‑6 months | Raise usage metrics and trust scores | **High** |\n| Low | Enable automated discovery & classification of new data sources via scheduled scans and AI‑based tagging. | Data Engineering Team | 3‑7 months | Improve completeness over time | **Low** |\n| Low | Add API endpoints for programmatic access to metadata, enabling downstream tools (BI, ML) to consume definitions. | Platform Architecture Lead | 4‑8 months | Increase integration with analytics stack | **Medium** |\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics  \n\n| Metric | Current | Target (6 M) | Target (12 M) | Measurement Method |\n|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|\n| Data Dictionary Completeness (critical terms defined) | 25 % | 55 % | 80 % | Quarterly data audit |\n| User Adoption Rate (analysts using catalog > 50 %) | 18 % | 45 % | 70 % | Usage analytics from platform logs |\n| Automated Capture Rate (metadata entries auto‑populated) | 12 % | 40 % | 70 % | ETL pipeline instrumentation |\n| Governance Process Compliance (change approvals executed) | 0 % | 60 % | 90 % | Change‑log review |\n| Data Trust Score average | 2.8/5 | 4.0/5 | 4.6/5 | Survey of data consumers |\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion  \n\nThe current state of the **Data Dictionary** is below the desired maturity level, largely due to fragmented tooling, limited awareness, and lack of automated capture. The recommended actions focus on consolidating metadata tools, formalizing governance processes, and building awareness through training and a business glossary. If implemented according to the outlined timelines, the organization can expect measurable improvements in dictionary completeness, user adoption, and overall data trustworthiness within 12 months."

Enhanced automation, better training, and centralized cataloging are identified as the most effective steps. Regular progress reviews and visible reporting should accompany all improvement initiatives."

Key gaps stem from limited technological integration, ad hoc enforcement, incomplete documentation, and low staff involvement. These factors collectively hinder robust validation, increase audit risk, and limit trust in metadata accuracy.\n\nImmediate priorities are tool integration, protocol formalization, and deepened stakeholder engagement through training and clearer process definitions. Success should be measured by improved average scores, higher compliance rates, widespread participation, and reduced audit issues. Regular progress monitoring and process refinement will be critical to achieving sustainable improvements."
